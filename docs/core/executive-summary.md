# Executive Summary

Yeşer is a minimalist gratitude journaling application for iOS and Android, built with React Native (Expo) and Supabase. The app is specifically designed for Turkish-speaking users, personified by our target persona, "Ayşe, The Peace-Seeking Millennial." Ayşe seeks a simple, calming, and effective tool to reduce daily anxiety, cultivate a positive mindset, and build a lasting daily gratitude habit.

**Project Goal:** To promote mindfulness and enhance mental well-being by providing an accessible and culturally resonant platform for consistent gratitude practice.

**Core Philosophy:** Yeşer emphasizes a user-centric design, focusing on simplicity, intuitive interactions, and a serene user experience. It aims to be a personal digital sanctuary, free of clutter.

**Development Approach:** The project follows a phased, feedback-driven development model. It began with a robust Minimum Viable Product (MVP) centered on core journaling functionalities and is progressively iterating to enhance user engagement and provide deeper value through features like advanced reminders and milestone visualizations.

**Key Features & Vision:**
*   **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up/login via email/password and Google OAuth.
*   **Onboarding:** A welcoming introduction to the app and gratitude journaling, including initial reminder setup.
*   **Daily Gratitude Entries:** A simple, focused interface for recording multiple gratitude items daily.
*   **Past Entry Review:** Access to entries via a chronological list, calendar view (Phase 3), and features supporting serendipitous review (e.g., random past entries).
*   **Entry Management:** Ability to view, edit, and delete past entries.
*   **Streak Tracking:** Robust visual motivation to maintain a consistent journaling habit, with streak calculations managed reliably by backend logic.
*   **Personalized Reminders:** Customizable daily notifications and future "Spark of Memory" throwback reminders (Phase 3).
*   **Theming:** Light and dark modes for user comfort.
*   **Settings:** Management of profile, reminder preferences, theme, and access to legal information.
*   **Milestones:** Future visual rewards for sustained practice ("Gratitude Blooming" - Phase 2).

**Technology Choices:**
*   **Frontend:** React Native with Expo for rapid, cross-platform (iOS & Android) development.
*   **Backend:** Supabase, utilizing its robust PostgreSQL database, authentication, storage, and critically, custom **PL/pgSQL functions (RPCs) and database triggers** for core business logic and data integrity.
*   **State Management:** Zustand for simple and effective global state management.
*   **Navigation:** React Navigation.
*   **Analytics:** Google Analytics 4 via `@react-native-firebase/analytics`.

**Value Proposition:** Yeşer offers a serene, intuitive, and effective mobile tool tailored for Turkish users to seamlessly integrate the practice of gratitude into their daily lives, fostering improved emotional well-being and a more positive outlook. The technical strategy prioritizes scalability, maintainability, and security, leveraging Supabase's capabilities for a robust backend where **data integrity is enforced through database-level constraints, custom SQL functions (RPCs), and automated triggers.** Monetization, if pursued, will favor user-friendly models like a one-time purchase or a thoughtfully designed freemium approach.
