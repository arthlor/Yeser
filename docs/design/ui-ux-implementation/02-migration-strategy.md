# Migration Strategy

This document outlines the approach for migrating from original components to enhanced themed components.

## Preparation Phase

- Document all screens using original components
- Create test cases for each screen to validate functionality
- Set up visual regression testing to compare before/after

## Implementation Phase

- Start with less complex screens (e.g., settings)
- Migrate one screen at a time using the enhanced components
- Keep both original and enhanced components during migration
- Update imports and props to use the enhanced versions

## Testing Phase

- Test each migrated screen thoroughly
- Verify accessibility compliance
- Check performance metrics
- Conduct cross-platform testing

## Finalization Phase

- Add deprecation notices to original components
- Document the new component usage in the codebase
- Remove original components once all screens are migrated
- Share migration learnings with the team
