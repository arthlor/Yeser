**Issues Found**:

```typescript
// app.config.js - Bundle identifier needs production update
const getBundleIdentifier = () => {
  // TODO: Currently using same bundle ID for all environments
  return 'com.arthlor.yeser'; // Should be com.yeser for production
};

// eas.json - Placeholder values need replacement
"appleId": "your-apple-id@example.com",  // ❌ Placeholder
"ascAppId": "1234567890",                // ❌ Placeholder
```

**Required Actions**:

- [ ] Set production bundle identifier to `com.yeser`
- [ ] Update EAS submit configuration with real Apple ID
- [ ] Configure App Store Connect ID
- [ ] Set up Google Play Console service account

#### 7. App Store Preparation ⭐⭐⭐⚫⚫

**Current State**: Basic configuration present

**Assets Status**:

- [ ] App icons exist but need verification for all sizes
- [ ] Screenshots not prepared for app stores
- [ ] App preview video not created
- [ ] Feature graphics not designed

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Blocking Deployment)

#### 8. Payment System ⭐⚫⚫⚫⚫

**Current State**: Not implemented

**Missing Components**:

```bash
❌ iOS StoreKit 2 integration
❌ Android Play Billing Library integration
❌ TypeScript payment interfaces
❌ Purchase flow implementation
❌ Receipt validation
❌ Restore purchases functionality
❌ Premium feature gating
```

**Impact**: Cannot deploy as premium app without payment system.

#### 9. Premium Feature Implementation ⭐⚫⚫⚫⚫

**Current State**: All features are free/unlimited

**Required Changes**:

- [ ] Implement purchase verification checks
- [ ] Add premium feature unlocking logic
- [ ] Create paywall components
- [ ] Implement trial/demo mode
- [ ] Add premium user identification

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED DURING AUDIT

### ⚠️ **Maximum Update Depth Exceeded Error - FIXED**

**Issue**: Calendar screen was experiencing infinite re-render loops causing "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors.

**Root Cause**: Theme color references in `useEffect` dependencies were causing cascading re-renders due to unstable object references.

**Solution Implemented**:

- Replaced unstable `useMemo` color references with stable `useRef` pattern
- Added change detection using string serialization to prevent unnecessary updates
- Eliminated all theme color dependencies from critical `useEffect` hooks
- Implemented functional state updates to prevent stale closure issues

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Infinite loop eliminated, calendar screen now stable.

**Impact**: This was a production-blocking issue that would have caused app crashes. The fix ensures the app is now truly deployment-ready from a stability perspective.

---

**Conclusion**: The Yeser app has an exceptional foundation with production-ready code quality, architecture, legal compliance, and now proven stability. The primary remaining blocker is the missing payment system implementation. Once payment integration is complete, the app will be ready for premium deployment with very high success probability.

**Next Steps**: Begin Phase 1 (Payment Integration) immediately to maintain deployment timeline.

**Last Updated**: Deployment Audit Completion  
**Next Review**: After payment system implementation  
**Auditor**: Comprehensive Codebase Analysis
