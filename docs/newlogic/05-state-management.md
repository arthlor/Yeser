# Module 5: State Management & Data Flow (Zustand)

**Goal:** Adapt global state to support the new data structure and ensure a reactive UI.

*   **Step 5.1: Review and Update Zustand Stores** [COMPLETED]
    *   The store holding daily entries (`dailyEntryStore` or `gratitudeStore`) should now manage the `statements` array as part of a daily entry object. [COMPLETED]
    *   Actions for adding, editing, and deleting statements should update this array in the store. [COMPLETED]
*   **Step 5.2: Implement Optimistic Updates** [COMPLETED]
    *   For a smoother UX, UI should reflect changes immediately (e.g., new statement appears in the list) while the backend call is in progress. [COMPLETED]
    *   Implement logic to revert optimistic updates if a backend call fails, with appropriate error feedback. [COMPLETED]
