## üîÑ Updated Rollback Procedures (Risk-Adjusted)

### Risk Levels by Category ‚úÖ **UPDATED**
- **‚úÖ Hook Dependencies**: No rollback needed - COMPLETED
- **‚úÖ TypeScript Any Types**: No rollback needed - COMPLETED  
- **‚úÖ False Positive ESLint Rules**: No rollback needed - COMPLETED ‚úÖ NEW
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Unused Variables**: Very low risk - auto-fix handles most cases
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Inline Styles**: Low risk - cosmetic improvements
- **‚ö†Ô∏è General ESLint**: Very low risk - simple variable cleanup

### Quick Rollback (Per Category)
```bash
# If unused variables cleanup causes issues:
git revert <commit-hash>  # Safe rollback
npm run test  # Verify functionality

# If style cleanup causes visual regressions:
git revert <commit-hash>  # Safe rollback  
npm start  # Verify UI intact

# If general ESLint cleanup causes issues:
git revert <commit-hash>  # Safe rollback
# Investigate edge case (apply our proven investigation approach)
```

### Investigation-Informed Rollback ‚úÖ **NEW**
```bash
# Use investigation skills to identify root cause:
npm run lint 2>&1 | grep "src/" | head -10  # Check remaining issues
git diff HEAD~1 -- src/problematic/file.tsx  # Understand changes
# Apply targeted fix rather than wholesale rollback
```

## üö® Updated Emergency Procedures

### If Unused Variables Cleanup Breaks Functionality ‚úÖ **NEW**
```bash
# Check for dynamic usage patterns
git diff HEAD~1 -- src/ | grep "const\|let\|import"
# Look for patterns like obj[variableName] usage
# Restore specific variables that are dynamically used
git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/specific/file.tsx
```

### If Style Cleanup Causes Visual Issues
```bash
# Visual regression - safe to rollback specific files
git revert <style-commit> --no-edit
npm start  # UI should be restored
# Apply manual style conversion to problematic files
```

### If ESLint Cleanup Breaks Logic  
```bash
# Check for debugging code that was actually needed
git diff HEAD~1 -- src/ | grep "console\|debug"
# Restore necessary debugging in production-critical paths
```

### Investigation-First Approach ‚úÖ **NEW**
```bash
# Before any rollback, investigate the root cause:
# 1. Understand what broke and why
# 2. Check if it's an edge case we missed
# 3. Apply targeted fix rather than wholesale rollback
# 4. Update our approach based on learnings
```

eslint --fix src/                # Unused imports (proven safe)
npm run cleanup:styles          # Inline styles (clear patterns)
npm run cleanup:colors          # Color literals (theme system)

# 3. Use manual approach for complex/uncertain cases
# Apply our proven manual pattern for edge cases
# Investigate any new suspicious patterns

# 4. Leverage perfect accuracy achieved
# All remaining warnings are legitimate - no false positive noise
```
