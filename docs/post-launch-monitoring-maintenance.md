Post-Launch Monitoring & Maintenance
Error Reporting & Crash Analytics
Sentry: Integrate sentry-expo to automatically capture and report JavaScript errors, native crashes, and unhandled exceptions in real-time.
Configure sourcemaps for Sentry to get de-minified stack traces.
Set up alerts for new or high-frequency issues.
App Store Consoles: Monitor Google Play Console (Crashes and ANRs) and App Store Connect (Diagnostics) for native crashes and performance issues reported by users.
Performance Monitoring
Supabase Dashboard:
Monitor database health, CPU usage, memory, and I/O.
Use the query performance tools to identify and optimize slow database queries.
Check Edge Function logs and execution times.
Expo Profiler & Flipper: Use during development and for targeted performance investigations on client-side (UI rendering, JavaScript execution, memory usage).
PostHog (or other Analytics): Track custom performance metrics if needed (e.g., time to complete key actions, screen load times from the client's perspective).
EAS Build & Update Dashboards: Monitor OTA update adoption rates and build success/failure rates.
User Feedback & Analytics
App Store Reviews: Regularly check Apple App Store and Google Play Store reviews for user feedback, bug reports, and feature requests.
PostHog (Usage Analytics):
Analyze user behavior, feature adoption, retention cohorts, and funnels.
Identify drop-off points in user flows.
Validate hypotheses for new features or improvements.
(Optional) In-App Feedback Mechanism: Consider a simple way for users to submit feedback or report issues directly from within the app.
Scheduled Maintenance
Dependency Updates (Quarterly or Bi-Annually):
Review and update major dependencies: Expo SDK, React Native, Supabase client, navigation libraries, and other key packages.
Test thoroughly after updates, as breaking changes can occur.
Run npm audit or yarn audit regularly and address security vulnerabilities promptly.
Supabase Maintenance:
Review database indexes and optimize if necessary.
Monitor storage usage.
Stay updated on new Supabase features or deprecations.
System & Security Review (Annually):
Review RLS policies in Supabase.
Check third-party service integrations for security best practices.
Ensure API keys and secrets are still secure and rotated if necessary.
Ongoing Maintenance (~10-20% of Development Time)
Technical Debt Refactoring: Continuously allocate time to refactor code, improve architecture, and address areas that are becoming complex or difficult to maintain.
Test Suite Enhancement: Improve and expand unit, component, and E2E tests to cover new features and edge cases.
Documentation Updates: Keep all project documentation (README, technical strategy, etc.) current.
Bug Fixing: Prioritize and address bugs reported through Sentry, app store reviews, or user feedback. Critical issues and regressions should be hotfixed promptly (potentially via OTA updates).
Best Practices
Staged Rollouts: For significant new features or changes, consider using feature flags or phased rollouts to a percentage of users to monitor impact before a full release.
Post-Release Monitoring: Closely monitor error rates, performance metrics, and user feedback immediately after each new app version release or major OTA update.
Communication: Inform users about significant updates, new features, or planned maintenance if it might affect their experience.
Backup Strategy: Ensure Supabase automated backups are active and understand the recovery process.
