## 游댮 Phase 1: Critical - Blockers for Launch

### 1.1 Fix iOS Google Sign-In Configuration

- **Priority:** 游댮 Critical
- **File:** `app.json`
- **Description:** The `iosUrlScheme` for the Google Sign-In plugin is a placeholder value. This will cause the OAuth flow to fail on all production and ad-hoc iOS builds.
- **Risk:** **Complete failure of Google Sign-In on iOS.** The app would be rejected by the App Store or be non-functional for iOS users using this sign-in method.
- **Action Items:**
  1.  Obtain the **Reversed Client ID** for your iOS app from your Google Cloud Console credentials page (or `GoogleService-Info.plist` file).
  2.  In `app.json`, replace `"com.googleusercontent.apps.YOUR_IOS_CLIENT_ID"` with the correct reversed client ID.
  3.  Rebuild the development client (`expo run:ios`) or a production build.
  4.  Thoroughly test the Google Sign-In flow on a physical iOS device to confirm it works.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** A user can successfully sign in with Google on a production build of the iOS app.

## 游 Phase 2: Major - Scalability & Performance

### 2.1 Optimize Multi-Prompt Fetching

- **Priority:** 游 Major
- **File:** `promptApi.ts`, Supabase Dashboard
- **Description:** The `getMultipleRandomActivePrompts` function currently fetches _all_ active prompts from the database and performs shuffling on the client.
- **Risk:** This is not scalable. As the number of prompts grows, this will cause slow load times, high data consumption, and increased memory usage on the client device.
- **Action Items:**

  1.  Create the following PostgreSQL function in your Supabase SQL Editor as suggested in the code's `TODO`:
      ```sql
      CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_multiple_random_active_prompts(p_limit INTEGER)
      RETURNS SETOF daily_prompts AS $$
      BEGIN
        RETURN QUERY
        SELECT * FROM daily_prompts
        WHERE is_active = true
        ORDER BY RANDOM()
        LIMIT p_limit;
      END;
      $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
      ```
  2.  Update the `getMultipleRandomActivePrompts` function in `promptApi.ts` to call this new RPC:

      ```typescript
      // In promptApi.ts
      export const getMultipleRandomActivePrompts = async (
        limit: number = 10
      ): Promise<DailyPrompt[]> => {
        try {
          const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('get_multiple_random_active_prompts', {
            p_limit: limit,
          });

          if (error) {
            throw handleAPIError(new Error(error.message), 'fetch multiple random active prompts');
          }

          return (data as DailyPrompt[]) || [];
        } catch (err) {
          // ... (error handling remains the same)
        }
      };
      ```

  3.  Remove the now-redundant client-side fetching and shuffling logic.

- **Acceptance Criteria:** The app fetches only the required number of prompts from the API, minimizing data transfer.

### 2.2 Optimize Deletion of Gratitude Entries

- **Priority:** 游 Major
- **File:** `useGratitudeMutations.ts`, Supabase Dashboard
- **Description:** The `deleteAllStatementsForEntryMutation` function deletes all statements for an entry by looping and calling the `deleteStatement` RPC multiple times.
- **Risk:** This is inefficient, generates unnecessary network requests, and is not an atomic operation. It could fail midway, leaving the entry in a corrupted state.
- **Action Items:**
  1.  Create a new, dedicated RPC function in Supabase that deletes an entire entry by its date. This is more efficient than deleting by ID, as the date is the primary user-facing identifier.
      ```sql
      CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION delete_gratitude_entry_by_date(p_entry_date DATE)
      RETURNS VOID AS $$
      BEGIN
        DELETE FROM gratitude_entries
        WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND entry_date = p_entry_date;
      END;
      $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
      ```
  2.  Create a new API helper function in `gratitudeApi.ts` to call this RPC.
  3.  Replace the `deleteAllStatementsForEntryMutation` logic in `useGratitudeMutations.ts` with a new `deleteEntryMutation` that calls the new, single RPC.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** An entire day's entry can be deleted with a single, atomic API call.

## 游리 Phase 3: Moderate - User Experience & Polish

### 3.1 Unify UI with a Reusable Toggle Component

- **Priority:** 游리 Moderate
- **Files:** `AppearanceSettings.tsx`, `DailyReminderSettings.tsx`, `SettingsScreen.tsx`, `FeatureIntroStep.tsx`
- **Description:** The settings screens use a custom-built animated toggle, while the onboarding flow uses a standard `Switch` from React Native Paper.
- **Risk:** Minor UI inconsistency, which can detract from a polished, professional feel.
- **Action Items:**
  1.  Create a new reusable component, `ThemedSwitch.tsx`, in `/src/shared/components/ui/`.
  2.  Encapsulate the custom animated toggle logic from `AppearanceSettings.tsx` into this new component.
  3.  Replace all instances of `Switch` and the custom toggle logic with the new `ThemedSwitch` component to ensure a consistent look and feel across the app.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** All toggle/switch controls in the app share the same design and behavior.

### 3.2 Implement a Non-Blocking Notification System (Toasts/Snackbars)

- **Priority:** 游리 Moderate
- **Files:** `DailyEntryScreen.tsx`, `EnhancedOnboardingFlowScreen.tsx`, `GlobalErrorProvider.tsx`
- **Description:** The app frequently uses `Alert.alert()` for showing mutation errors and other feedback, which is a blocking, jarring user experience.
- **Risk:** Poor UX that interrupts the user's flow.
- **Action Items:**
  1.  Choose a library (e.g., `react-native-toast-message`) or build a custom `ToastProvider` using a `Portal`.
  2.  Integrate this provider at the root of the application, likely within `AppProviders.tsx`.
  3.  Modify `GlobalErrorProvider.tsx` to use this new toast/snackbar system instead of `Alert.alert`.
  4.  Refactor screens like `DailyEntryScreen` to use this system for non-critical feedback (e.g., "Settings saved").
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Errors and notifications are displayed in a non-blocking manner, improving the overall user flow.

## 游릭 Phase 4: Minor - Code Health & Refinement

### 4.1 Optimize Total Entry Count Query

- **Priority:** 游릭 Minor
- **File:** `gratitudeApi.ts`
- **Description:** The `getTotalGratitudeEntriesCount` function uses a `select('*')` query, which is slightly less efficient than a dedicated count query. The function's JSDoc already suggests a more optimal RPC.
- **Risk:** Negligible at small scale, but could become a minor performance issue with very large tables.
- **Action Items:**
  1.  Implement the `get_user_gratitude_entries_count` RPC in Supabase if it doesn't already exist.
  2.  Update the `getTotalGratitudeEntriesCount` function to call this RPC instead of the `select` query.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** The total entry count is fetched using the most efficient query possible.

### 4.2 Refactor Auth Logic into Service Layer

- **Priority:** 游릭 Minor
- **File:** `authStore.ts`, `authService.ts`
- **Description:** The `loginWithGoogle` action in the Zustand store (`authStore.ts`) contains complex business logic related to `expo-web-browser` and OAuth redirects.
- **Risk:** This violates the principle of separation of concerns, making the state management store harder to test and maintain.
- **Action Items:**
  1.  Ensure the full implementation of the `signInWithGoogle` flow resides within `authService.ts`.
  2.  Update the `loginWithGoogle` action in `authStore.ts` to be a simple proxy that calls `authService.signInWithGoogle()` and handles setting the `isLoading` and `error` state.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** The `authStore` is responsible only for state, while the `authService` handles all implementation details of authentication.

## 游 Phase 5: Post-Launch & Future Enhancements

### 5.1 Implement CI/CD Pipeline

- **Description:** Automate the build, test, and deployment process for consistency and speed.
- **Action Items:**
  - Set up GitHub Actions or a similar service.
  - Create workflows for linting, testing, and running validation scripts on every pull request.
  - Automate builds and submissions to app stores using EAS Submit.

### 5.2 Enhance Monitoring & Crash Reporting

- **Description:** Proactively monitor application health and track errors in production.
- **Action Items:**
  - Integrate a service like Sentry or Firebase Crashlytics.
  - Add more detailed context (e.g., user ID, current screen) to error reports within the `ErrorBoundary` and `GlobalErrorProvider`.
  - Set up performance monitoring to track API response times and screen load times.

### 5.3 Introduce Feature Flags

- **Description:** Implement a system for remotely enabling or disabling features without requiring a new app release.
- **Action Items:**
  - Use a service like Statsig, LaunchDarkly, or a simple Supabase table.
  - Wrap new or experimental features (like `ThrowbackTeaser`) in a feature flag check.
