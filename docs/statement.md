🎯 PROBLEM ANALYSIS
The current StatementCard is a monolithic 800+ line component trying to serve 4 different UI/UX contexts:
🏠 Home Screen (ThrowbackTeaser) - User says "cluttered and bad UI/UX"
📝 Daily Entry Screen - User says "cluttered and bad UI/UX"
📖 Entry Detail Screen - User says "cluttered and bad UI/UX"
📋 Past Entries Screen (PastEntryItem) - User says "I like this, keep it"
