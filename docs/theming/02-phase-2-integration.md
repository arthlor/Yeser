# Phase 2: Integration & Refactoring

This phase involves integrating the theme provider into the application and refactoring existing components to use the new theming system.

### 1. Integrate `ThemeProvider` (Completed)

*   **Wrap Root Component:** The application's root component (e.g., in `App.tsx`) has been wrapped with the `<ThemeProvider>` from `src/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx`.
    *   This makes the theme context (current theme object and theme-switching functions) available to all descendant components via the `useTheme` hook.
*   **Dependencies:** Ensure `zustand` and `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` are installed.

### 6. Refactor Components (Initial Pass Completed)

*   **Component Refactoring:**
    *   Core application screens (including Authentication, Onboarding, Daily Entry, Past Entries, and Settings) and common components have been updated to use the `useTheme()` hook.
    *   Hardcoded style values (especially colors, spacing, and typography) have been replaced with semantic theme tokens (e.g., `theme.colors.background`, `theme.colors.primary`, `theme.typography.body1`, `theme.spacing.medium`).
    *   A consistent styling pattern, using `StyleSheet.create` with a function that accepts the theme object (e.g., `const styles = createStyles(theme);`), has been adopted.
*   **Theme Definition Extension:**
    *   The theme definitions in `src/themes/types.ts`, `src/themes/lightTheme.ts`, and `src/themes/darkTheme.ts` have been significantly upgraded to `EnhancedAppTheme`. This major update introduced a comprehensive set of semantic color tokens (including 'on', 'container', and 'onContainer' variants), expanded typography scales, more granular spacing units, border radius options, elevation styles for depth, animation presets, responsive breakpoints, and a system for component variants (e.g., for buttons, inputs, cards). This provides a much richer and more consistent styling foundation.
*   **Ongoing Process:** While the initial pass is complete, further minor adjustments and refactoring may occur as new components are developed or existing UI is refined.

### 7. Implement Theme Switching UI (Completed)

*   **Location:** An option has been added to the app's settings screen (`src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx`).
*   **UI Component:** A `Switch` component is used to toggle between light and dark themes.
*   **State Interaction:** The `Switch` interacts with the `themeStore` by calling the `toggleTheme` action obtained via the `useTheme` hook.
*   **Visual Feedback:** The app's theme changes immediately upon selection. The settings UI itself was already using themed styles and correctly reflects the new theme.
