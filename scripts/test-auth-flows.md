# üîê Authentication Flow Testing Guide

This guide helps you thoroughly test magic link authentication in production builds before submitting to app stores.

## üö® Critical Tests (Based on Past Issues)

### 1. Splash Screen Hanging Test

**Issue**: Production APK hangs on splash screen due to expo-dev-client import
**Test**:

- Open production build
- App should load completely within 10 seconds
- Should NOT hang on splash screen indefinitely
- Should reach login screen or main app (if authenticated)

### 2. Magic Link Authentication Flow

**Test Scenario**: Complete end-to-end authentication

#### Step 1: Initial Login

1. Open production build
2. Navigate to login screen
3. Enter valid email address
4. Tap "Magic Link G√∂nder" button
5. Verify success message appears
6. Check email inbox for magic link

#### Step 2: Magic Link Handling

1. Open magic link email on same device
2. Tap the magic link
3. **Critical**: App should open automatically
4. App should navigate to authenticated state
5. User should be logged in successfully

#### Step 3: Deep Link Validation

Test the deep link scheme: `yeser://auth/callback`

```bash
# Test deep link manually (Android)
adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "yeser://auth/callback?access_token=test&refresh_token=test" com.your.package.name

# Test deep link manually (iOS Simulator)
xcrun simctl openurl booted "yeser://auth/callback?access_token=test&refresh_token=test"
```

### 3. Google OAuth Testing

**Test Scenario**: Alternative authentication method

1. Tap "Google ile Giri≈ü" button
2. Google sign-in flow should open
3. Complete Google authentication
4. App should return and authenticate user
5. User should be logged in successfully

## üß™ Production-Specific Tests

### Environment Variable Validation

Verify these are properly set in production:

```bash
# Check these are available in production build
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
EXPO_PUBLIC_APP_NAME
```

### Network Connectivity Tests

1. **Online Authentication**: Test with strong internet
2. **Slow Network**: Test with slow/intermittent connection
3. **Offline Behavior**: Test app behavior when offline
4. **Network Recovery**: Test app recovery when connection restored

### Performance Tests

1. **Memory Usage**: Monitor RAM usage during auth flows
2. **CPU Usage**: Check for excessive CPU usage
3. **Battery Impact**: Monitor battery drain during testing
4. **App Size**: Verify installed app size is reasonable

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Magic Link Opens Browser Instead of App

**Symptoms**: Magic link opens in browser, doesn't return to app
**Solution**: Check deep link scheme configuration in app.config.js

```javascript
scheme: "yeser",
```

### Issue: Authentication State Not Persisting

**Symptoms**: User logged out on app restart
**Solution**: Check AsyncStorage permissions and Supabase session handling

### Issue: Supabase Connection Errors

**Symptoms**: Network errors, failed API calls
**Solution**: Verify Supabase URL and anon key in production environment

### Issue: Google OAuth Failures

**Symptoms**: Google sign-in fails or errors
**Solution**: Check Google OAuth configuration and bundle ID

## üì± Device-Specific Testing

### Android Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test on Android 8+ (minimum supported version)
- [ ] Test with different screen sizes
- [ ] Test deep link handling from email apps
- [ ] Test with different keyboards
- [ ] Test with accessibility features enabled
- [ ] Test with different system languages

### iOS Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test on iOS 13+ (minimum supported version)
- [ ] Test with different screen sizes
- [ ] Test deep link handling from Mail app
- [ ] Test with VoiceOver enabled
- [ ] Test with different system languages
- [ ] Test with reduced motion enabled

## üîÑ End-to-End Test Script

Run this complete test sequence before submitting to EAS Build:

```bash
# 1. Validate production build
node scripts/validate-production.js

# 2. Build and install production app
chmod +x scripts/test-production-builds.sh
./scripts/test-production-builds.sh

# 3. Manual authentication testing
# - Complete magic link flow
# - Test Google OAuth
# - Test app state persistence
# - Test deep link handling

# 4. Performance testing
# - Monitor memory usage
# - Check for crashes
# - Test network error handling

# 5. Final validation
# If all tests pass, ready for EAS Build!
```

## üìä Success Criteria

Your app is ready for EAS Build when:

- ‚úÖ No splash screen hanging (app loads completely)
- ‚úÖ Magic link authentication works end-to-end
- ‚úÖ Deep links open app correctly
- ‚úÖ Google OAuth functions properly
- ‚úÖ Authentication state persists across app restarts
- ‚úÖ No memory leaks or crashes during testing
- ‚úÖ App performs well on target devices
- ‚úÖ Network error handling works correctly
- ‚úÖ All critical user flows function properly

## üö® Red Flags (Do NOT Submit)

Stop and fix if you see:

- ‚ùå App hangs on splash screen
- ‚ùå Magic links don't open the app
- ‚ùå Authentication fails silently
- ‚ùå App crashes during auth flows
- ‚ùå Memory usage grows continuously
- ‚ùå Network errors aren't handled gracefully
- ‚ùå Deep links open browser instead of app

## üìû Debugging Production Issues

### Enable Debug Logging

Add this to your production testing build (remove before final submission):

```typescript
// In your auth service
console.log('Auth state:', { isAuthenticated, user: user?.email });
console.log('Deep link received:', { url, tokens });
```

### Network Monitoring

Use these tools to monitor network calls:

- **Android**: Chrome DevTools + Remote Debugging
- **iOS**: Safari Web Inspector
- **Both**: React Native Flipper (if configured)

### Error Tracking

Monitor these console outputs during testing:

- Authentication errors
- Network failures
- Deep link handling errors
- Supabase connection issues

**Remember**: Thorough testing here saves you EAS Build quota and prevents app store rejections!
